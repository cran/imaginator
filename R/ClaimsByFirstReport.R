#' @title Claims by first report
#'
#' @description
#' Given a data frame of policies, this will simulate the number of claims- and their initial payment-
#' per policy by the development lag at which they are first reported.
#'
#' @param tbl_policy A policy data frame.
#' @param frequency A list of the same length as `lags` of number of claims per policy or their distributions.
#' @param payment_severity A list of the same length as `lags` of payment amount for each claim or their distributions.
#' @param lags A vector of lags as integers.
#'
#' @details
#' Creates a data frame with randomly generated claim values.
#'
#' @return A claims data frame
#'
#' @importFrom magrittr %>%
#' @importFrom tibble tibble
#'
#' @examples
#'
#' # This will generate a claim data frame which has 1,000 records
#' # each of which has a severity of 100
