#' Simulate general insurance policies, losses and loss emergence. The package contemplates
#' deterministic and stochastic policy retention and growth scenarios. Retention and growth rates are percentages relative
#' to the expiring portfolio. Claims are simulated for each policy. This is accomplished either be assuming a frequency
#' distribution per development lag or by generating random wait times until claim emergence and settlement. Loss simulation
#' uses standard loss distributions for claim amounts.
